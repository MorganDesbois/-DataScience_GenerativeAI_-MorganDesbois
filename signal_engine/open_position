# Open position
Using the new column with (1,-1,0), the goal is to generate a new column to generate some buy/sell postions.


## Generate Buy signals based on Crossover_Signal
gold_data['Buy_Signal'] = (gold_data['Crossover_Signal'] == 1).astype(int)

## Generate Sell signals based on Crossover_Signal
gold_data['Sell_Signal'] = (gold_data['Crossover_Signal'] == -1).astype(int) * -1


**Finally, this code generates buy and sell signals based on the 10-day and 50-day moving average crossovers. It adds two new columns (Buy_Signal and Sell_Signal) that indicate when to enter or exit positions.**
