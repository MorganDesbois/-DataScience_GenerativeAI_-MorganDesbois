## 1. Initial Prompt
Hello, I would like your help with the creation of a GitHub for an assessment
I want you to be clear and detailed, and explain the reasoning or steps behind each part.
My objectives is: create a data science tools allowing me to identify investment opportunities on gold with breakout of supports and resistances                                                                                        My constraints are: No major contracts, I have to document my work and include in my work this discussion.                                                                                                                                                             Instructions from the module leader: "2.3 Individual Assignment (post-module)
• Over the course of the module you will be asked to build up a
GitHub repository of the work you do. This will be part of the
assessment, but also acts as an online portfolio of your work.
• In the end-point assessment you will be asked to reflect upon
your GitHub repo and the elements that you feel are most
important to your development in AI and data science. You will
also be asked to reflect on how these methods will impact your
future career.
• There will be an additional question relating to a topic in data
science and AI (standard format)"                        
The final result should be an algo that can identify supports and resistances, take position on gold, close the position, create a panel, use protection against loss, take profit level.
