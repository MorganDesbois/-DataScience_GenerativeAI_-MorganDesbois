I want to download historical gold price data from January 1, 2015, up to today using the yfinance library.
The goal is to develop a MA trading strategie
I need a clean table (DataFrame) that includes columns such as Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and any other features necessary to design and test this algorithm.
