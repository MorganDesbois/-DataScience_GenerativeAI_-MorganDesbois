# A trailing stoploss moves with the price when the trade goes in our favour and closes the trade if the market turns 

trailing_stop_pct = 0.005  # 0.5% trailing distance
trailing_stop_price = max(trailing_stop_price, current_price * (1 - trailing_stop_pct))

** This protects profits automatically while letting winning trades grow **
