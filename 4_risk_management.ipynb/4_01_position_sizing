# We choose how big each trade should be so the system never risks too much at once. A simple fixed size or a small percentage of the account keeps risk stable.

# Calculate how many units to trade
risk_amount = account_balance * risk_per_trade
position_size = risk_amount / (entry_price - stop_loss_price)

** This helps the strategy stay safe and avoid oversized trades **
