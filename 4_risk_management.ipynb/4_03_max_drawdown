# For additional protection, we set a limit on how much the account can lose before the system stops trading. 
If this limit is reached, trading pauses

# Closes trades if account equity drops below allowed drawdown

max_drawdown_pct = 0.10  # 10% max loss
max_drawdown_level = account_balance * (1 - max_drawdown_pct)

if current_account_balance <= max_drawdown_level:
    close_all_positions()


** This rule prevents large losses and protects the account from big drawdown **
