## 1. Introduction Prompt: ##

Hello, I would like your help with the creation of a GitHub for an assessment

I want you to be clear and detailed, and explain the reasoning or steps behind each part.

My objective is: create a data science tools allowing me to identify investment opportunities on gold with breakout of supports and resistances                                                                                       

My constraints are: No major contracts, I have to document my work and include in my work this discussion.                                                                                                                                                             
Instructions from the module leader: "2.3 Individual Assignment (post-module)
• Over the course of the module you will be asked to build up a
GitHub repository of the work you do. This will be part of the
assessment, but also acts as an online portfolio of your work.
• In the end-point assessment you will be asked to reflect upon
your GitHub repo and the elements that you feel are most
important to your development in AI and data science. You will
also be asked to reflect on how these methods will impact your
future career.
• There will be an additional question relating to a topic in data
science and AI (standard format)"                        

The final result should be an algo that can identify supports and resistances, take position on gold, close the position, create a panel, use protection against loss, take profit level.




## 2. Structuration: ##

Please create a clear and detailed repository structure including the main directories (for example: src, docs, data, tests), important files (for example: README.md, .gitignore, LICENSE), suggested subfolders for each main directory, and a short description of the purpose of each folder and file.
Format the output as a tree-like structure so I can easily follow it. Also, explain why you recommend this structure and how it will help me manage my project efficiently.




## 3. Starter Scripts ##
I would like your help to create the starter scripts for my project.

Please provide Python scripts with a basic structure to start analyzing gold prices and identifying supports and resistances. Include:
- Importing necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc.)
- Placeholder for loading data
- Placeholder for calculating supports and resistances
- Placeholder for trading logic (entering/exiting positions, take profit, stop loss)
- Basic plotting functions for visualization
- Clear comments explaining each step and TODOs for future additions

Also, provide a minimal folder structure for the scripts and data, so that the project is ready to be expanded.
Format the output clearly, so I can copy-paste the code and start developi
