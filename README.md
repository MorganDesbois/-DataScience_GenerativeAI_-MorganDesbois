### Main Project: Investment gold strategie

**Context:** 
In the face of geopolitical tensions and market uncertainty, gold is often considered a safe-haven asset and protection against crisis. This project studies how breakout signals of supports and resistances in gold prices can be detected and used to profit of the actual economy and geopolitical context. 

**Why gold ?**
-High volatility
-High volume implying liquidity 
-Strong momentum perfect for breakouts
-Accessible assets compared to real institutional tools


**Objectives:**
-Collect and **prepare gold market time series**, spot and future prices.
-**Build and compare a simple breakout system**  and a ML-assisted version to filter false signals.
-Implement out-of-sample backtests to evaluate robustness by **conducting a backtest**
-**Document the use of a GenAI** tool to generate code, explain methodological choices, and write analyses.
