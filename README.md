# Main Project: Investment gold strategy

In the face of geopolitical tensions and market uncertainty, gold is often considered a safe-haven asset and protection against crisis. This project studies how moving averages can be used to identify trading opportunities and potentially profit from the current economic and geopolitical context. It includes data collection from historical gold prices, preprocessing, strategy development with moving average crossovers, backtesting, and risk parameter optimisation. The repository contains all the notebooks, code, and outputs needed to reproduce the analysis.<br><br><br>

### Why gold ?

-High volatility

-High volume implying liquidity 

-Strong momentum perfect for breakouts

-Accessible assets compared to real institutional tools <br><br><br>


### Objectives

-Collect and **prepare gold market time series**.

-**Build and compare a simple MA system**  and a ML-assisted version to filter false signals.

-**Implement backtests and performance metrics** to evaluate robustness.

-**Discover new AI** specially adapted to the finance environment.<br><br><br>
